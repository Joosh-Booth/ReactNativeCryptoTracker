# ReactNativeCryptoTracker

A basic React Native project that will let you track your crypto purchases.

I have found crypto purchasing applications dont give you a great overview of your previous purchases and whether you have made or lost money overall. 
So I thought I would mess around and learn React Native to give myself something to do.

# Current Progress

Homepage basic layout created.

Table of purchases displayed.

Changable ASC DEC column arrows added to column headings.

Currency picker added to column headings.
